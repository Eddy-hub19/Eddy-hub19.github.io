      Ulysses, Ulysses — Soaring through all the galaxies. In search of Earth,
      flying in to the night. Ulysses, Ulysses — Fighting evil and tyranny, with
      all his power, and with all of his might. Ulysses — no-one else can do the
      things you do. Ulysses — like a bolt of thunder from the blue. Ulysses —
      always fighting all the evil forces bringing peace and justice to all.

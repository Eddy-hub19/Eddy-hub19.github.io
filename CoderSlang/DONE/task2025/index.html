<h2>Tags structure</h2>
<p>All tags have names that are enclosed in angle brackets, or, in other words, signs less than `<` and greater than `>`</p>

<h2>Paired tags</h2>
<p>Paired tags have two parts: an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag is distinguished by the presence of a `/` before the tag name.</p>
